# DevNet2020
for Cisco DevNet Associate certification
I am working on getting my Cisco DevNet certification before the end of 2020. 
I've created this Branch to contain all the work I'm doing for Associate level Certification. 
I will create a separate "branch" for the next level which is "Professional". 
This will help me learn how to use "branches" in GitHub.
